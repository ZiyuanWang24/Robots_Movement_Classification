# Software components
We create a jupyter notebook file, Comparison_of_classifiers.ipynb, to manage and visualize the data. In the file, there are five different machine learning classification algorithms to analyze the ultrasounds data. The results are shown as confusion matrix and predication accuracy.
## src/Classifiers.py:
It is a python class file that includes the Linear Classification, Support Vector Machine, KNN Classification, Neutral Network, and Gaussian Naive Bayes.
Input: Orignal data set in .csv format.
Output: robots_movement_classifier class which is ready for training in different classification algorithm.
## robots_movement_classifier.knnclassifier_learning():
Input: None
Ouput: Confusion matrix, prediction accuracy, trained model of KNN Classification algorithm.
## robots_movement_classifier.SVM_learning():
Input: None
Ouput: Confusion matrix, prediction accuracy, trained model of Support Vector Machine Classification algorithm.
## robots_movement_classifier.GaussianNB_learning():
Input: None
Ouput: Confusion matrix, prediction accuracy, trained model of Gaussian Naive Bayes Classification algorithm.
## robots_movement_classifier.Linear_Classifier():
Input: None
Ouput: Confusion matrix, prediction accuracy, trained model of Linear Classification algorithm.
## robots_movement_classifier.NeuralNet_Classifier():
Input: None
Ouput: Confusion matrix, prediction accuracy, trained model of Neutral Network Classification algorithm.
