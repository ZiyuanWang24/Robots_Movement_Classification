# Who will be the users?

Our optional user could be storage manager, autopilot testing engineer, and autonomous delivery company. They have their designed road map direction and testing direction data. But they also need a software used to analyze the data to print out the predicted direction. 

# What do they want to do with your software?

Our software will identify the automotive vehicle direction. During the road tests of the design vehicle’s road mapping. The experiment could collect the car’s distance or super sound sensor data to determine its rotating direction.

Our softwre is used to analyze the test data to print out the rotating direction, this result experiment direction will also be used to compare with the setting direction to improve the original route plan of the autopilot.

# User stories

1. A food delievery company would like to improve their new autopolit food delievery robot. After they have received their first running data. they could upload their distance sensor detecting data, they will get a result of a suggest direction to compate with the origional rout mapping to design a better route.

2. A storage manager would like to increase the size of their storage, so they have to redesign their robotic moving path. based on the shelf location and the distance between each shelf. they could uploda the data to have the result of the turning direction for the rebotic.

3. An autopilot testing engineer would like to get the feedback of their new sensor. after the testing in the setting route path they could upload their distance or supersoud data during the turing, they could get a output of the turning direction.
