# Robots Movement Classification
This tool can be used to determine the position and orientation direction based on the information provided by sensors.

## Project objective
The project is to use the ultrasound sensor data or distance reading data of the wall-followed robot to train a model. The model can be used to determine the position and orientation direction based on the data analyzed. We will try different machine learning algorithm and find out a model that has better prediction.
